## About

EscolaETH bridges the gap between traditional Web2 education systems and emerging Web3 technologies by integrating blockchain-based credentials with a strategic portfolio of domains including:

- escola.eth
- universidade.eth
- faculdade.eth
- fatec.eth
- emprego.eth
- nome.eth
- nome.digital
- nome.social

This approach delivers a seamless experience for students, educational institutions, and employers — no matter their blockchain literacy.

## Why EscolaETH?

Brazil faces three critical challenges in education and employment:

- **Credential Fraud:** The country loses over R$ 2 billion annually due to forged diplomas.
- **Identity Fragmentation:** Student records are siloed in disconnected systems.
- **Barriers to Opportunity:** Lack of portable credentials slows academic mobility and hiring.

EscolaETH addresses these issues by issuing blockchain-backed academic credentials that are secure, verifiable, and easy to share.

## Our Mission

- Empower students with **ownership of their academic identity**.
- Provide institutions with a **trusted, scalable credential platform**.
- Enable employers to **reliably verify candidate qualifications**.
- Create a **powerful Web2-Web3 bridge** for education in Brazil and beyond.
